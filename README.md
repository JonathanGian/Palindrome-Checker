## Overview

The **Palindrome Checker** is a web application built using TypeScript and React. It allows users to input a string and checks whether the string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). The app uses a simple algorithm to clean and validate the input and provides immediate feedback.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive UI for entering text.
- Real-time palindrome checking on form submission.
- Strips non-alphanumeric characters and ignores case sensitivity.
- Lightweight and fast implementation with modern web technologies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonathanGian/palindrome-checker.git
   cd palindrome-checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open in your browser:
```http
http://localhost:5173
```

## Usage

1. Type a word or sentence into the input field.

2. Click the "Check" button.

3. The app will display "Yes, it is a palindrome." if the input is a palindrome, or "No, it is not a palindrome." otherwise.

### Example Inputs

- Input: `"Racecar"` → Output: `Yes`
- Input: `"Hello"` → Output: `No`
- Input: `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` → Output: `Yes`
